Improved Dimer Method - General Calculation Steps:
1) Run CI-NEB calculation with 5-10 images to find the closest structure to TS.
2) Run frequency calculation on the selected structure:
   - Fix all slab atoms
   - Use a 1x1x1 k-mesh
   - Use vasp_gam for calculations
   Settings:
   NSW = 1
   IBRION = 5
   POTIM = 0.015
   EDIFF = 1E-7
   NFREE = 2
   NWRITE = 3 # Must be 3
3) Run this script:
   get_dimer.py 
4) Use the POSCAR for IDM calc:
   NSW = 500           
   IBRION=44           # Use the dimer method as optimization engine
   POTIM = 0.05
